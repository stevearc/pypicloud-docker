Pypicloud Docker
================

This is a docker container for running pypicloud. To test pypicloud and see it
working, run this command:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 stevearc/pypicloud
```

This will start pypicloud with default settings inside the docker container and
serve it on port 8080. The default settings are sufficient to play with, but
they should not be used in production.

You can access the `pypicloud-make-config` command from the docker image, which
will give you a decent starting config that you can customize for your use.

```
docker run -it --rm stevearc/pypicloud make-config
```

The config file in the container is located at `/etc/pypicloud/config.ini`. To
use your own config file, mount it as a volume.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
    -v /path/to/my/config.ini:/etc/pypicloud/config.ini:ro \
    stevearc/pypicloud
```

See the [list of configuration
options](http://pypicloud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/configuration.html)
for details about the config file.
